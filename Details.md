Time series(under Prof. Prabir Burman and Prof. Joshua Patrick): I first made a time series decomposition and analyzed the trend, seasonal term and residual, then analyzed the stationary of the time series and built a two factor addictive model. Seasonal terms are regressed with lowess and Trigonometry. According to the MSE, I used cubic spline and trigonometric functions to regress, used stepwise with AIC to select variables. But the results showed the seasonal terms are over-fitted, we proposed a new function—absolute value of trigonometric to fit.

Nonlinear time series analysis (under Prof. Xiaohua Yang): My work involved studying a time series method -- Set pair analysis(SPA). I proposed refined Set pair analysis methods by applying chaotic time series analysis for nonlinear time series, and compared it with AR, BP neural network. A paper published.
